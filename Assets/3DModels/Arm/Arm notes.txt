to use the arm control its motions 
to use the and animations for Petteia set the Petteia bool to ture 
this is in place to keep the hand motions from inyerfering with cotobos

to routate the arm use animamator.getfloat(name) or animamator.setfloat(name,vale)
animamator.getfloat(Upper_arm_angle_UP_Down); (-1=down, 1=UP)
animamator.getfloat(Upper_arm_angle_Forward); (0=nutral, 1=forward)// no need to move backwards so I did not make a clip for that
animamator.getfloat(lower_arm_angle); (0=nutral, 1=forward)//dose not work right now

// each animation on the arm as a mask on it other than the cotobos clips 
the mask was set up in the fbx inport settings 
this was needed as the mask cant be set for non-human clips other waise
I added the second arm to bing in the arms movement clips that the origanal did not have


//for the bend trees
each clip in the blend tree is more of a pose than an animation and each one is give an (x,y) coordinate.
I set them between 1 and -1 for each direction so for example (0,1) is the pose to move the arm all the way up 
were as (-1,0) is all the way to the left (.5,1) is 50% between nutral and left and 100% up.

controlling the float values is how you can get any possible angle
note the lower arm only move one way as the elbow as it can only move one way
