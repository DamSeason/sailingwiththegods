Deipnosophists@1.5@wriggling polyp@The wriggling polyp, if it be rather large, is much better boiled than baked, if you beat it until it is tender.@server@

Deipnosophists@2.51@mulberries@Then there is the fruit of the mulberry-tree, which is a delight to little boys, and is the first to proclaim the pleasant fruit season to mortals.@server@
Deipnosophists@2.52@almonds@Almonds eaten before the symposium are very provocative of thirst.@@
Deipnosophists@2.55@Chick-peas@Chick-peas are hard to digest, but purgative, diuretic, windy.@@
Deipnosophists@2.56@olives@Diphilus of Siphnos says that olives afford little nourishment and cause headache; black olives, moreover, are worse for the stomach and oppressive to the head.@@
Deipnosophists@2.57@radishes@Any man who goes to market to get some delicacy and prefers to buy radishes when he may enjoy real fish must be crazy.@@
Deipnosophists@2.58@eggs@In the Art of Cookery [they] say that peacocks' eggs excel all others; after them come the eggs of the fox-goose; they put hens' eggs third.@@
Deipnosophists@2.59@colocynth@The colocynth is not filling; it is easily digested, adds moisture to the system, is easily passed, and juicy.@@
Deipnosophists@2.6@mushrooms@You are like mushrooms: you will dry me up and choke me to death.@@
Deipnosophists@2.62@truffles@It is said, namely, that they grow when the autumn rains come with severe thunderstorms; the more thundering there is, the more they grow.@@

Deipnosophists@2.68@pumpkin@A pumpkin is not edible when raw, but is good to eat when boiled or baked.@@
Deipnosophists@2.69@leeks@Ye leek-devouring grubs, which go up and down the leafy gardens in tracks made by fifty feet, and lay hold with your feet upon the long-tailed satyr-plant, winding your choral bands in and out among the leaves of basil and lettuce and fragrant celery.@@
Deipnosophists@2.69@lettuce@Dark lettuce is more cooling, and is digestible as well. Lettuce grown in summer is juicier and more filling, while the autumn lettuce lacks nourishment and is less juicy. The stalk of the lettuce is supposed to cure thirst.@@

Deipnosophists@3.87@conchs@Why! all the conchs, as at a single command open wide for us and the flesh of each one pokes out.@@
Deipnosophists@3.89@pinna@The pinna opens its shell and quietly waits for small fish to approach, while the parasite stands by and bites it as a signal when anything comes near; the pinna feels the bite and closes, and in this way they eat up together whatever is caught inside.@@
Deipnosophists@3.9@nettles@Nay, thou bravest daughter of ascidian grandmothers and motherkins who were nettles.@@
Deipnosophists@3.91@ear-mussels@Ear-mussels are hard to digest, although more nourishing when fried.@@
Deipnosophists@3.91@urchins@Urchins are tender, juicy, of high odour, filling, and easily digested; again, when eaten in sweet pickle, with parsley and mint, they are wholesome, sweet, and well-flavoured.@@
Deipnosophists@3.93@mollusk@The jewel occurs in the flesh of the mollusk, like the tubercle in swine, and is sometimes so very golden in appearance that when placed side by side with gold it cannot be readily distinguished from it; sometimes, again, it is silvery, and sometimes perfectly white, resembling the eye of a fish.@@

Deipnosophists@3.96@swine@The people of Argos sacrifice swine to Aphrodite, and the festival is called the Feast of Swine.@@
Deipnosophists@3.101@pig matrix@Rather, let me be cheered by a casserole or the lovely countenance of a miscarried matrix, or a sucking pig whose smell comes deliciously from the oven.@@
Deipnosophists@3.104@crayfish@The fishmongers have voted, so people say, to raise a bronze statue of Callimedon in the fish-market at the next Panathenaea, holding in his right hand a crayfish; for they regard him as the sole saviour of their business, all other customers being a loss.@@
Deipnosophists@3.105@shrimps@The squirming shrimps leaped forth like dolphins into the rope-twined pot.@@
Deipnosophists@3.107@caul@The leader he hid in a caul'; also in his Envoys: 'round the loin and the caul@@
Deipnosophists@3.109@oven-bread@Seeing that a dough-pan fresh from the fire was lying there, I ate some of the oven-bread piping hot.@@
Deipnosophists@3.11@hot rolls@Fetch me the paunch of a sucking-pig killed in the autumn, with some hot rolls.@@
Deipnosophists@3.111@cake@There was a cake, my master, as big as this, and white; it was so thick that it bulged from the basket, and when the cover was taken off, an odour and a steam mingled with honey rose upward to the nostrils; for it was still hot.@@
Deipnosophists@3.112@Athenian bread@How could a man of gentle breeding ever leave this roof, when he sees these white-bodied loaves crowding the furnace in close ranks, and when he sees, too, how they have changed their shape in the oven - deft imitations made by Attic skill, which Thearion taught his countrymen?@@

Deipnosophists@3.113@Cappadocian bread@The Greeks have a bread called 'soft,' which is made with a little milk and oil and sufficient salt; the dough must be quite soft. This bread is called Cappadocian, since it is chiefly in Cappadocia that 'soft' bread is made.@@
Deipnosophists@3.113@boletus bread@There is also a 'boletus' bread, so-called, shaped like a mushroom. The kneading-trough is greased and sprinkled with poppy-seed, on which the dough is spread, and so it does not stick to the trough during the rising.@@
Deipnosophists@3.115@amolgaia@A hearty barley-cake and milk from goats just running dry.@@
Deipnosophists@3.116@sturgeon@Not inglorious in the eye of mortals, I ween, is the tribe of sharp-nosed sturgeon which jagged lumps of salt adorn either whole or sliced.@@
Deipnosophists@3.116@tunny@Now Diocles of Carystus, in his work entitled Hygiene, says that young tunny is the best among all lean varieties of salt fish, but of all fat fish the grown tunny is the best.@@
