A good guide can tell you the route, how to avoid the rocks waiting to smash your ship, the whirlpools like Charybdis!@Attractive benefits! But are they good company on a journey?@You know the talkative type! Plutarch says “talkativeness hurries off what is said like the retiring sea, and anon brings it up again multiplied with the approaching tide” (Moralia 399)
A guide of the wisest sort – who knows the name of every landmark between here and there!@Wisdom for hire – who would say no?@You know the talkative type! Plutarch almost pities them: over-talkers are bound by fate to want more listeners, but people just run away when they see them coming, and tell their friends to do the same (Moralia 400)
A guide who knows the gods who oversee the ships passing by – the local nymphs, the buried heroes, who can reach out from their tombs to help you on your way.@By Zeus, powerful promises! Can such good ever come without a blend of the bad?@Those over-talkers, you know them! Plutarch says when such a man walks into a room everyone falls as quiet as if Hermes himself had entered the assembly, and then when he starts his yammering they feel as they do ‘before a storm at sea, when Boreas is blowing a gale round some headland’: everybody feels dizzy, anticipates nausea, and just runs away (Moralia 401)
You want a guide as handsome as Hermes (but just as good looking)@Are they all such wise owls – no foolish twittering among them?@The kind of talkers who can never, ever find people willing to dine with them, not a single messmate when traveling, only those who can’t manage to get away (Plutarch Moralia 401)
Why there are men here who trekked with Alexander, former footsoldiers whore call every port – that’s the kind of man to hire!@@You know what they are like! Just like Plutarch says, plucking your clothes or your chin, always at you, digging you in the ribs with his elbow (Moralia 401)
The best guide can regale you enroute with every story of the place – History! Myth! The local wonders, the local customs!@@Overtalkers! The kind of people who inspired Archilochus to say, when you encounter them, ‘then are your feet of greatest value’ – so you can get away! (Plutarch Moralia 402)
You can hire in this town a guide as well traveled as Herodotus himself! And just as full of stories.@@Remember what Aristotle said to a chatterbox? “It’s a miracle that anyone with a pair of legs stops to listen to you!’ (Plutarch Moralia 401)
I can steer you to find a veritable Polemon of Ilium, a Diodorus of Sicily, a writer who’s given his life to the craft of travel!@@Aristotle, when asked by an over-talker if his chatter bored him, replied ‘not by Zeus! I am ignoring you! (Plutarch, Moralia 403)
Why I can find you a writer of periploi, careful books that detail coastal routes@@
You need yourself a periegete! “those men who are accustomed to take strangers about to all those things which are worth going to see, and to show them every separate thing, whom they call mystagogi,” (Cicero Against Verres 2.4.132)@@
You can hire a guide who was a priest in that place! You know the Egyptian priests would meticulously record in their sacred books, and thus store away, all sorts of curious information: this man embraced that habit as well! (Strabo 17.1.129)@@
