Deipnosophists@1.26@Falernian@"Falernian is sufficiently aged for drinking after ten years, and good from fifteen to twenty years; any that surpasses this limit induces headache and attacks the nervous system."@
Deipnosophists@1.26@Sorrentine@"The Sorrentine begins to be good after twenty-five years; since it lacks oil and is very rough, it takes a long time to ripen; even when it is ripe, it is barely wholesome except for those who use it continually."@
Deipnosophists@1.26@Rhegium@"The wine of Rhegium, which contains more oil than that of Sorrentum, is fit to use after fifteen years." @
Deipnosophists@1.26@Tiburtine@"The Tiburtine is thin, easily evaporates, and matures in ten years; but it is better when aged." @
Deipnosophists@1.26@Labican@"Labican is sweet and oily to the taste, ranking midway between Falernian and Alban; it may be drunk at the earliest after ten years."@
Deipnosophists@1.26@Marsic@"Marsic is very dry and wholesome"@
Deipnosophists@1.27@Fundan@"The Fundan is strong, heavy-bodied, and apt to attack head and smooth; hence it is not often drunk at symposia."@
Deipnosophists@1.27@Signine@"The Signine is good in the sixth year, but much better when aged."@
Deipnosophists@1.27@Nomentan@"The Nomentan matures quickly and is drinkable after the fifth year; it is neither too sweet nor too thin."@
Deipnosophists@1.27@Spoletine@"The Spoletine wine is sweet to the taste and of a golden colour." @
Deipnosophists@1.27@Barine@"The Barine is very dry and constantly improves."@
Deipnosophists@1.27@Venefran@"The Venefran is wholesome and light."@
Deipnosophists@1.27@Trebellic@"The Trebellic of Naples is temperate in its effect, wholesome and tasty."@
Deipnosophists@1.27@Erbulan@"The Erbulan is at first dark, but becomes white after a few years; it is very light and delicate."@
Deipnosophists@1.27@Marseilles@"The wine of Marseilles is good; but it is uncommon, rich, and full-bodied."@
Deipnosophists@1.27@Tarentum@"The wine of Tarentum, and in fact all the wines of that latitude, are soft, having no violent effect and no strength; they are sweet and wholesome." @
Deipnosophists@1.27@Mamertine@"The Mamertine, to be sure, grows outside of Italy; in Sicily, where it grows, it is called Iotaline. But it is sweet, light, and vigorous."@
Deipnosophists@1.28@Lesbian@"There's not another wine pleasanter to drink than a draught of Lesbian"@
Deipnosophists@1.28@Pramnian@"I like the Pramnian wine of Lesbos. Many the drops of Lesbian that are gulped down eagerly."@
Deipnosophists@1.33@Abates@"Abates is merely a laxative."@
Deipnosophists@1.33@Mareotan@"The Mareotan wine — also called Alexandreotic — gets its names from Lake Mareia in Alexandria and the city so named near it."@
Deipnosophists@1.33@Tarniotic@"This Taeniotic wine, beside being pleasant, has also an aromatic quality, and is mildly astringent. The vine is as abundant in the Nile valley as its waters are copious, and the peculiar differences of the wines are many, varying with colour and taste."@
Deipnosophists@1.33@Thebaid@"The wine of the Thebaid, and especially the wine from the city of the Copts, is so thin and assimilable, so easily digested, that it may be given even to fever patients without injury."@
