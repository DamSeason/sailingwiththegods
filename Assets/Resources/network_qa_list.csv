Alope@how well connected are the people of Alope? Are many Greeks in their networks of friends?@It’s not for its network that you would put in! You’d sooner find a river nymph on a Cycladic rock than a network associate of that little town – they have none at all.
Anthedon@Friendly or insular, open or closed, what will I encounter as the networks of this town?@They are in the network of Aetolians. They extend from one end of the world to the other! Kyzikos rich in gold staters,  Syracuse with her green fields and fine temples, the islands of Crete and Sicily, Thracians skilled in trade and iron, and the Phoenicians of noble Sidon..all the way into the Black Sea.
Doris@Will the city care for the networks that hold bind cities together?@not a whit! They neither give proxenia, nor honor the bonds of other cities. 
Euboia@are Euboeans skilled at weaving the bonds that tie the world together?@Not at all! No networks claim them as their friends
Histiaia/Oreos@How networked to friends across the sea are the people of Histiaia?@Clever and foresightful are the people of this town! They are among the network of the Aitolians, masters of weaving connections from Sidon to the far west, as well as the people of Epidauros of Argos. Folks would flock to Epidauros to be healed by Asclepius himself – it is a sanctuary worth seeing! And the town had ties across the Peloponnese.
Histiaia/Oreos@How networked to friends across the sea are the people of Histiaia?@The proxenoi of this city stretch from one side of the sea to another!  To Athens with her deep harbors, wealthy Kyzikos on the Propontis, mighty Halikarnassos where Mausolus reigned! Macedonians strong in battle, Aitolians reputed as pirates, and the people of Tenedos, famous for their wine. And they are bound by these ties to the people of sacred Delphi, where Apollo gives his oracles to all the world.  32 cities appear in one inscription alone: the town knows and loves its proxenoi! (IG XII.9.1187)
Iolcus@Iolcus is my home! Or it is meant to be: my father Aeson is the rightful king, but my wicked uncle Pelias has stolen the throne: I may tell you, if you had many hours, of how I was raised by the wise centaur Chiron, hidden in the hills, how Athena herself crafted my ship, how Hera the queen of the gods is always on my side, how rumors of a golden fleece (!) have floated about our trip…. @But let us be practical, young hero! As you set out on your journey, you know that you have never relied on the contracts among cities for your bravery on the sea or in battle: the people of Iolcus partake in no network, but do recognize the value of networks. You can select your crew, in part, for the friends they bring you!
Kerinthos@Does this town partake in network friendships?@a bald man has more use for a comb than does this town for friends abroad!
Larissa (Thessaly)@Is this town part of the networks that tie the world together?@Indeed! Both the network of the Samothracians, famous for the mysteries that preserve men on the sea, and the Aitolian league that stretches across the Aegean
Narthakion@do the people of Narthakion cultivate friendships abroad?@indeed they do! A single inscription names twenty seven cities among their friends: they are welcomed at Athens with her violet crown, Miletos the jewel of Asia, Magnesia on the Maeander, the river that rushes to the sea, Achaians in Aigion – this town celebrates its proxenoi! (IG IX 2.90)
Opus@Do the people of Opus have friends abroad, networks that link them across the waves?@Not a one! They embrace independence, and count on other means to connect themselves to other Greeks. Five pillars are lined up in the neighborhood of Thermopylae, near its Polyandrion, where the noble dead are honored. 
Pagasae@do the people of this town have network friends abroad?@no! they are as independent as they are ancient: long ago a Mycenaean port, and before that the neighbors of the towns more than ancient, Sesklo and Dimini, where Neolithic men built walls and fine ceramics, traded in goods that came across the sea, and stamped their possessions with signs of ownership.
Pelion@will I find men here who claim formal friendships in other ports?@no, but you will find legends in abundance!
Pherae@Is Pherae a place for network connections?@Its travelers are as lonely as lost little chicks when they travel abroad! No welcoming ties are forged in advance: they must chat up every stranger as best they may!
Phthia@Do the people of Phthia have friends in foreign ports, or welcome travelers into their own networks?@You may remember the tale of Penelope, who unplucked every night the fabric she wove to fool the suitors who lurked in her halls. Nothing to unpluck in the web of Phthia! They travel without the safety net of friends established in advance.
Phylace@The people of Phylace, do they sustain the networks that tie the Greeks together, though separated by miles of sea?@They care less for networks like a barbarian cares for grammar!
Skiathos@I have heard of this tiny island, in a fortunate spot! Do they have network friends who recognize this value?@Skiathians care not for friendships abroad – tight friends in a tight space, their eyes are only on their fellow citizens
Tisaia@do the folk of Olizon care for network ties?@No more than a wolf cares for the feelings of a sheep!
ALLOTHERS@What are the network connections of this city?@{Grab network list - net_Ids from settlement_list spreadsheet connects to ids on available_networks spreadsheet}
