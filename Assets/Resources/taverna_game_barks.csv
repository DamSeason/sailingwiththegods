You are the kind of man who runs into the Town Dining Hall with an empty belly and comes out full!%(Aristophanes’ Knights)@insult
You are a brutal master, a perfect glutton for beans, and most bad-tempered!%(Aristophanes' Knights)@insult
How loudly you snore and fart! I'm cheating you right and left and you don't even see me!%(Aristophanes' Knights)@insult
You possess all the attributes of a demagogue; a screeching, horrible voice, a perverse, cross-grained nature, and the language of the market-place.%(Aristophanes' Knights)@insult
This public robber, this yawning gulf of plunder, this devouring Charybdis, this villain, this villain who is a villain a thousand times a day. %(Aristophanes' Knights)@insult
Oh! you scoundrel! You impudent bawler! Greedy and cheating, you lie in wait like a fisherman waiting for the tunny-fish.%(Aristophanes' Knights)@insult
I'm the champion of players! Even after I gulp down ox trip, sow's belly, and the gravy that goes with it, greasy and slobbering, I'll beat you at this board game!%(Aristophanes' Knights)@bragging
I'm going to win, I tell you! I'll flay you and make your skin into a thief's purse! I'll slice you into mince-meat! I'll tear out your eyelashes! Get set to whine!%(adapted from Aristophanes' Knights)@bragging
You cheat! May all that food you're gobbling make you sick as a dog! And when you are I'll start my song: 'Time to drink, time to drink, drink up, my friends, the day is bright!'%(Aristophanes' Knights)@bragging
I swear I'll beat you, swear it by this fine round stomach I've built by eating other people's greasy leftovers!%(Aristophanes' Knights)@bragging
I will throw myself upon you like a terrible hurricane! I'll ravage you a storm lashing sea and land, fury its guide, all unchecked!%(Aristophanes' Knights)@bragging
Yours are the gods of rascals and braggarts, of all fools and toad-eaters, and of the marketplace where unbridled audacity, untiring chatter, and a shameless voice are the key to success!%(Aristophanes' Knights)@bragging
If I'm not going to win this game, may I be cooked in a stew, grated on this table with some cheese and then hashed, may a hook be passed through my guts and haul me to the city gate!%(adapted from Aristophanes' Knights)@bragging
You're like men who fish for eels: they catch nothing in still waters, so they always stir up the slime!%(Aristophanes' Knights)@bragging
