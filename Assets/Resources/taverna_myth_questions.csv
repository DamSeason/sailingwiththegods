Alope@What tales can you tell me of Alope's past?@This town is named for a princess who loved the sea god! She was the daughter of the king of Eleusis: Poseidon the god of the waves fell in love with her, and she bore him a child Hippothoon, named for swift horses - appropriate for that horse-loving god! The horsey little lad was abandoned by his mother, but a mare nursed it until the shepherds found him. Eventually the royal little tyke was brought to the king: alas for his mother, the king - his own grandfather! - recognized who he was and locked up his mother as punishment, starving her to death. As for the boy, Poseidon eventually turned him into a spring: a watery fate for a watery boy!%(Pherekydes BNJ 3 F 147; Hyginus Fabulae 187, 238)
Alope@What tales can you tell me of Alope's past?@Alope lies in the territory of Achaea Phthiotis; behind the city looms Mount Othrys, where Kronos and the Titans had their base when the Titans warred against the Olympians. There too were born the great god Poseidon, Hades who rules the underworld, Hera wife of Zeus, Demeter, and Hestia. You will sail into legendary territory!
Anthedon@What are the tales of Anthedon?@Anthedonians are famous for covetousness - keep a sharp eye on your wallet there! The Boiotians say that greed lives in Oropos, envy in Tanagra, stupidity in Haliartus and covetousness in Anthedon!%(Herakleides Criticus, Bios Ellados 25)
Anthedon@What are the tales of Anthedon?@This town has its poets! Anthes of Anthedon was the first author of hymns%(Ps-Plutarch, On Music 2.3)
Anthedon@what are the tales of Anthedon?@Be sure to order carefully at your restaurants there! The hake fish grows to great size around Anthedon, but its meat is rather spongy, not very pleasant, at least to me, though some like it.% (Athenaeus Deipnosophistae 7.316)
Anthedon@What are the tales of Anthedon?@Old tombs and old tales await you! Mycenaean remains are to be seen, and the place flourished from a fine fishing and seafaring industry. And the tales of Glaukos have their start here - he was a fisherman, and an excellent diver, but more than mortal: he has become a god of the sea and a powerful prophet. Some say that he visits, every year, every island and every beach, accompanied by sea monsters and making prophecies.%(Pausanias 9.22.6)
Anthedon@What are the tales of Anthedon?@Anthedon is the home of Glaukos, the prophesying demon of the sea - and I saw it myself, his transformation into a God! I was not bleary-eyed or peering vainly to no purpose when I saw this fearful thing, this awful happening. You know, I am a countryman and of these parts; and I am always about the land here opposite Chalcis, and am used to accompany the grazing cattle from the byre to Messapion's leafless lofty crag. And it was from here that my eye lit upon it. I saw it when I had come to the bend of Euboia, about the headland of Zeus Crenaeus, right by unhappy Lichas' tomb.%(adapted from Aeschylus Fr. 273) 
Anthedon@What are the tales of Anthedon?@The town is the home of the sea-god Glaukos! You may have heard of him: Plato tells us 'The nature of the sea-god Glaukos can hardly be made out by those who catch glimpses of him, because the original members of his body are broken off and mutilated and crushed and in every way marred by the waves, and other parts have attached themselves to him, accretions of shells and sea-weed and rocks, so that he is more like any wild creature than what he was by nature.'%(Plato Republic 611d)
Anthedon@What are the tales of Anthedon?@By the sea at Anthedon in Boiotia is what is called the Leap of Glaukos. That Glaukos was a fisherman, who, on eating of the grass, turned into a deity of the sea and ever since has foretold to men the future, is a belief generally accepted; in particular, sea-faring men tell every year many a tale about the soothsaying of Glaukos.%(Pausanias Description of Greece 9.22.7)
Anthedon@What are the tales of Anthedon?@You would sail into the home of the sea-god Glaukos! 'So Glaucus of Anthedon, the fisher of the Boeotian sea, having tasted Circe's deadly herbs, when he had plucked those plants cropped by his dying fish, plunged into the Carpathian sea, there to find a new home: that fisherman, so skillful with his hooks and nets, who ransacked Nereus' hidden depths and swept the surface which is Tethys' realm that spoiler tossed on the waves amid the shoals he once took captive'%(Ausonius Mosella 240)
Doris@Tell me of this place, Doris.@This city bears the name of a sea nymph! Doris was the wife of Nereus, god of the sea, and the mother of fifty beautiful Nereids; she is the right goddess for this city, as she rules over the fishing grounds that flourish where fresh rivers meet the salt sea: her name means 'pure gift', an apt title for a goddess with access to sweet river water! Hesiod sings her tale: 'Doris of the lovely hair, daughter of Okeanos the river that encircles us all; to Nereus she bore, even in the barren sea, daughters whose beauty is outstanding even among the gods'.%(Theogony 240-244)
Doris@Tell me of this place, Doris. @In the name of this city lies the Dorian race - those who think 'Doris' means 'woodland' or 'upland', appropriate for its mountain slopes! Dorians are the children of Herakles, who drove away the Dryopes from this site to claim it as their own: you may call them 'hunger Dorians', since they took such rich farmland! The soil is deep, the water abundant, springing from the Kephissos river; three mountain ranges protect her round about. Those Dryopes were brigands, pirates of the dry land: from there they ranged far and wide%.(Skylax 62)
Euboea@What can you tell me of the island?@This island has had many names! Some used to call it 'big' (Makris), others 'Long' (Doliche), - others Abantis, for the warrior tribes who lived here (Iliad 2.540-541, 'the raging Abantes who held Euboia and Chalcis and Eretria and Histiaia with its fine vineyards, and Kerinthos on the sea'.) Now we call it 'The land of the well-fed oxen', Euboia.
Euboea@What can you tell me of the island?@After rounding Sounion from Attike the island Euboia lies ahead, previously called, they say, Makris ('long') from its nature, next from the so-called Asopis, taking with time again the name Euboia. The first to inhabit it, they say, were mixed Lelegian settlers; Pandoros the son of Erechtheos crossed over from Attike to found Chalkis, the largest city on it, and Aiklos, an Athenian by race, founded Eretria, and likewise Kothos founded Kerinthos on the shore; Dryopes founded the city named Karystos, while Hestiaia was a foundation of the Perrhaibians. Islands lie near it, Skyros, Peparethos, Skiathos; the Cretans who crossed over from Knossos with Staphylos once settled Peparethos and Ikos, the island lying near it, while legend says Pelasgians crossed over from Thrace to settle Skyros and Skiathos. The Chalcidians resettled all of them after they became deserted.%(Geographi Graeci Minores 566)
Euboea@What can you tell me of the island?@This place may only be an island because of the hand of Poseidon: earthquakes shook it, long ago, and it may have been these that separated it from the mainland Greeks.%(Thucydides, Strabo)
Euboea@What can you tell me of the island?@It is the first place the Greeks, sailing to Troy, found themselves stalled! At Euboia, near Chalcis, Agamemnon and his men were held in place when the winds were denied them, due to the king's arrogance and his offense to Artemis.
Euboea@What can you tell me of the island?@Euboians are famous traders! Their weights and measures are used for trade throughout Asia Minor.
Euboea@What can you tell me of the island?@The nymph of the island is as famous as the island is grand in size and reputation. Euboea was the nymph of the fountain, daughter of the river god Asopos. She stole the heart of the sea-god Poseidon; he stole her from her father, brought her to the island, and made it her home forever.%(Diodorus Siculus 4.72.1; Corinna Fr. 654) 
Euboea@What can you tell me of the island?@Poseidon is worshipped here – and in the cities the Euboians founded! He is honored at Mende, as shaker of the earth and god of the sea; in Zankle in the far west, the god’s own son Orion set up his father’s sanctuary; on Euboea itself Orion has a cult. And in Aigai on Euboia, Poseidon has a shrine (Hesiod Fr. 149 MW; Diodorus Siculus 4.85; Strabo 9; Pausanias 9.20.3).
Euboea@What can you tell me of the island?@"Euboea worship mighty Briareos: Of him Hesiod wrote: ""Three other sons, Hekatoncheires were born of Gaia and Ouranos, great and doughty beyond telling, Kottos and Briareos and Gyes, presumptuous children. From their shoulders sprang a hundred arms, not to be approached, and each had fifty heads upon his shoulders on their strong limbs, and irresistible was the stubborn strength that was in their great forms."""
Euboea@What can you tell me of the island?@Euboea worship mighty Briareos: Hesiod tells his story: 'But the glorious allies of loud-crashing Zeus, the Hekatonkheires, have their dwelling upon Okeanos' foundations, namely Kottos and Gyes; but Briareos, being goodly, the deep-roaring Earth-Shaker Poseidon made his son-in-law, giving him Kymopoliea ('Wave-Roaming') his daughter to wed.'
Euboea@What can you tell me of the island?@Euboea worship mighty Briareos: Plato claimed, 'If a man were gifted by nature with the frame of a Geryon or a Briareus, with his hundred hands, he ought to be able to throw a hundred darts.'%(Laws 795c)
Euboea@What can you tell me of the island?@Euboea worship mighty Briareos: Virgil reports: 'Many monstrous forms besides of various beasts are stalled at the doors of Hades, Centaurs and double-shaped Scyllae, and the hundredfold Briareus, and the beast of Lerna the Hydra, hissing horribly, and the Chimaera armed with flame, Gorgons and Harpies and the shape of the three-bodied shade Geryon.'%(Aeneid 6.287-90)
Euboea@What can you tell me of the island?@Euboea worship mighty Briareos: Aelian cites Aristotle, saying that 'before the pillars of Herakles were so called they were known as the pillars of Briareos. But when Herakles purified both land and sea and became indisputably the benefactor of mankind, men honored him, named the pillars after Herakles and ceased to honor the memory of Briareos.'%(Historical Miscellany 5.3)
Histiaia/Oreos@If I hire a guide, will he have tales to tell me?@Some think it has its name because Orion was raised here, that handsome giant and hunter! He followed in the company of Artemis on Crete (Apollodoros Bibliotheca 1.4.3; Hyginus Poeticon Astronomicon 2.34); some say she loved him, and Apollo tricked her into shooting him as he swam in the sea. Or it may be that he loved her against her will, so she sent him a monster of a scorpion to kill him (Horace Carmina 2.4.72; Apollodoros Bibliotheca 1.4.5). It lies at the foot of the mountain Telethrius, on the river Callas, on a high rock.%(Strabo 10.1.4)
Histiaia/Oreos@If I hire a guide, will he have tales to tell me?@Artemis Proseoa is celebrated here - 'Artemis who faces the East' - this is where the navy of the Greeks anchored in 480 for three days, as they fought off the fleet of Persian Xerxes, who here sought critical access to the gulf. Plutarch reports that the temple was surrounded by a wall made of marble that gave off the scent and color of saffron when rubbed.%(Themistokles 8.1)
Histiaia/Oreos@If I hire a guide, will he have tales to tell me?@This is a land rich in vines, ruled once upon a time by the ferocious Abantes: 'the raging Abantes who held Euboia and Chalcis and Eretria and Histiaia with its fine vineyards, and Kerinthos on the sea' (Iliad 2.540-541). Those Abantes descended from Ares, and were generous of spirit; they wore their hair long in battle, tying it at their backs and shearing it at the front, a haircut called the 'Theseis' for the great Theseus.%(Plutarch Theseus. 5.1; Homer Iliad 2.540-550)
Histiaia/Oreos@If I hire a guide, will he have tales to tell me?@The territory of this town once covered the entire northern half of Euboia, the great island
Histiaia/Oreos@If I hire a guide, will he have tales to tell me?@Former enemies, settlers and rulers are now among its network of friends! They are now aligned with Athens, but long ago they were part of an uprising against that city, and even murdered the crew of one of her ships. Because of this the Athenians sent 2000 settlers to Histiaia's shores (Livy 28.6.2; 31.46.9). Later it was part of the Athenian league (Livy 28.5.18), then ruled by Macedon. 
Iolcus@Do you know the myths of my homeland?@Here lies a temple of Artemis Iolkia.
Iolcus@Do you know the myths of my homeland?@The town itself is 'rich in grapes' (Deipnosophistae 4.172), and well cultivated (Orphic Argonautica 1369).
Kerinthos@What tales can you tell me of this place?@There are minerals here famous for their properties. Theophrasuts wrote, 'There appears to be a kind of earth in some places, which when sprinkled over the seed helps to make wheat keep, for instance, the earth found at Olynthos and at Kerinthos in Euboea; this makes the grain inferior for food, but fuller in appearance; the earth is sprinkled in the proportion of one pint to twenty-four of grain.'%(Enquiry into Plants, 8.11.6)
Kerinthos@What tales can you tell me of this place?@This is a small town (Strabo 10.446), near the banks of the river Budorus: Kothos of Athens was her founder, and she was sufficiently tied into the world of Greek cities to send ship to Ilium to fight against the Trojans!%(Iliad 2.538; Pliny Natural History 4.12.21).
Larissa (Thessaly)@What stories are told of this town?@It was founded by Akrisios, whom his grandson Perseus killed by accident

Narthakion@What can you tell me of this place?@They were long in a dispute with Meliteia, one of their neighbors in Thessaly.
Opus@When I come to from that town, what tales will I hear?@They may sit you down and regale you with tales of the son of Zeus named Opus, born to him by Protogeneia, the daughter of Deucalion; their town is one of the first of Greece!

Pagasae@What tales can you tell me of this town?@The centaur Chiron himself compounded herbs gathered on the hills of Pagasae, with which he tended wounds.%(Ovid, Fasti, 5.379)
Pagasae@What tales can you tell me of this town?@Some people believe that the place has its name from the construction of your ship, the Argo! (Hyginus Astronomica 2.37.1) And I have heard the legend that the ship refused to sail out onto the unknown waters, to places she had never known, until 'the sea, summoned by the lyre, obeyed the music and came up to the stern of the sacred bark'.%(Silius Italicus, Punica, 11.449). 
Pagasae@What tales can you tell me of this town?@Now some folks argue (and I think they are right) that the place comes from the name of its foundations, many in number and abundant in their waters (Strabo 9.5.15) Indeed it's famous for its hot springs! (Pliny the Elder, Natural History 12.37, 31.39.1)
Pagasae@What tales can you tell me of this town?@Well they're famous for selling slaves, 'and branded rascals at that'.%(Athenaeus Deipnosophistae 1.27) 
Pelion@The mountain is the source for the wood of my ship! Poets to come will sing of that fact: 'Once they say pine-trees born on the heights of Pelion floated through Neptune's clear waves, to the River Phasis and Aeetes' (Catullus 64.1). And it is great in size: Dicaearchus, a savant of the first rank, with the support of royal patrons took the measurement of mountains, and published that the highest of them was Pelion, with an altitude of 1250 paces (Pliny the Elder, Natural History 1-11, 2.65.1) I know some stories of this place - can you tell me more?@Wise old Herodotus tells us the tale of the shipwreck of the Persian fleet - and the mountain's role in it! 'When the darkness had come on, although the season was the middle of summer, yet there came on very abundant rain, which lasted through the whole of the night, with crashing thunder from Mount Pelion; and the dead bodies and pieces of wreck were cast up at Aphetai and became entangled round the prows of the ships and struck against the blades of the oars: and the men of the army who were there, hearing these things became afraid, expecting that they would certainly perish, to such troubles had they come; for before they had had even breathing space after the shipwreck and the storm which had arisen off Mount Pelion, there had come upon them a hard sea-fight, and after the sea-fight a violent storm of rain and strong streams rushing to the sea and crashing thunder'.%(Histories 8.12)
Pelion@I know some stories of this place - can you tell me more?@It is the source of medicinal herbs: the type that thrive in cold regions, as centaury and wormwood, and further those that have medicinal properties in their roots and juices, such as hellebore, squirting cucumber, scammony, and nearly all those whose roots are gathered. Some which grow on Pelion are found as well in Pontus and Thrace, some about Oeta, Parnassus, Ossa and Telethrion, and in these parts some say that there is great abundance.%(Theophrastus Enquiry into Plants 4.5.1-2) 
Pelion@Worthy details, but are there not myths to share?@It is an infamous place, for infamous deeds of the immortals themselves! Otos and Ephialtes, whose names mean 'insatiate' and 'ﾘnightmare', were the sons of Iphimede, wife of Aloeos, whom she bore to Poseidon. They were of extraordinary size - they each grew nine inches every month, and so when they were nine years old, they tried to climb into heaven. They began this way: they placed Mount Ossa on Pelion (from this Mount Ossa is also called Pelion), and were piling up other mountains. But they were discovered by Apollo and killed. ...When they wished to assault Artemis, she could not resist their strength, and Apollo sent a deer between them. Driven mad by anger in trying to kill it with javelins, they killed each other. In the Land of the Dead they are said to suffer this punishment: they are bound by serpents to a column, back to back. Between them is a screech-owl, sitting on the column to which they are bound'.%(Hyginus, Fabulae 28)
Pelion@I know some stories of this place - can you tell me more?@Virgil sings of it: 'Three times, indeed, they tried to pile Ossa on Pelion, and roll wooded Olympus on top of Ossa: three times Zeus split the mountain pile apart with his lightning bolt.'%(Georgics 1.259)
Pelion@I know some stories of this place - can you tell me more?@Great terror was visited on Zeus by all those bold warriors bristling with hands, and by the brothers who tried to set Pelion on shadowy Olympus.%(Horace Odes 3.4)
Pelion@I know some stories of this place - can you tell me more?@Ovid says it best: 'I never believed, though Ossa supported Pelion, I had the power to touch the bright stars with my hand, nor did I join Enceladus'%(Letters from Pontus 2.2.1)
Pelion@I know some stories of this place - can you tell me more?@Zeus, omnipotent, shot thunderbolts through Mount Olympus, and he overturned from Ossa huge, enormous Pelion'%(Ovid Metamorphosis 1.151) 
Pelion@I know some stories of this place - can you tell me more?@Here Aloeus' sons Gigantic rose against the gods, what time Pelion had almost touched the stars supreme, And Ossa's loftier peak amid the sky Opposing, barred the constellations' way'%(Lucan, Pharsalia 6.480)
Pelion@And what will I find there?@Crags of the mountain tower above this port; north of it lies the Tomb of Dolops. The mountain's slopes can drive storms and thunder into the sea.%(Herodotus 812)
Pelion@What can you tell me of the land of Pelion?@You must know that it is the land of centaurs - the race descended from Ixion, who assaulted Hera - or thought he did! It was a cloud he attacked, not the goddess herself, but the cloud bore him a child - a monstrous offspring - there was never a mother or a son like this - honored neither by men nor by the laws of the gods. She raised him and named him Centaurus, and he mated with the Magnesian mares in the foothills of Pelion, and from them was born a marvelous horde, which resembled both its parents: like the mother below, the father above. The gods accomplish everything according to their wishes.%(Pindar Pythian 2.25)
Pelion@Chiron the centaur, my old tutor and friend, indeed dwells there - he raised me there as he tended 'the son of Peleus, swift-footed Achilles, pre-eminent among men, on woody Pelion, for he was still a boy.'%(Hesiod F 68-89).@Chiron had a magical lyre that could stir up the storms of the sea: 'A third lyre, whose strains moulded the minds of heroes and the spirit of great Achilles in the cave of Mount Pelion - the lyre that Chiron loved, could quell the raging sea or the wrath of Hell itself, when he struck the strings.'%(SIlius Italicus, Punica 11.449) 
Pherae@Is the place known among the poets - have great deeds happened here?@This is the land of King Admetus, who's famous for shame rather than bravery! He let his own wife take his place in Hades when it was time for him to die. The women of the land mourned her loss: 'Cry out, Oh, lament. O land of Pherae, For the best of women Fades away in her doom Under the earth, To dark Hades' (Euripides Alcestis 201). But Herakles the great, the son of Zeus, recovered her from Hades. 
Phthia@What tales can you tell me of this place?@As Homer says in his Iliad: 'But now, seeing I am not minded to battle with goodly Hector, tomorrow will I do sacrifice to Zeus and all the gods, and heap well my ships, when I have launched them on the sea; then shalt thou see, if so be thou wilt, and carest aught therefor, my ships at early dawn sailing over the teeming Hellespont, and on board men right eager to ply the oar; and if so be the great Shaker of the Earth grants me fair voyaging, on the third day shall I reach deep-soiled Phthia'.%(Homer, Iliad, 9.346 - ca. 700 BCE )
Phthia@What tales can you tell me of this place?@Or like her, beautiful Cyrene, who dwelt in Phthia by the water of Peneus and had the beauty of the Graces%(Hesiod, Fragments, CW.F92 - ca. 650 BCE )

Phthia@What tales can you tell me of this place?@And here I dwell upon the boundaries of Phthia and Pharsalia's town, where Thetis erst, the goddess of the sea, abode with Peleus apart from the world, avoiding the throng of men; wherefore the folk of Thessaly call it the Thetideion, in honour of the goddess's marriage.%(Euripides, Andromache, 1 - ca. 425 BCE )
Phylace@What tales can you tell me of this place?@A sanctuary to the hero can be found in the city (Pindar Isthmian 1.83); here they honor him with games! His cult and myth continued even after the city became part of Thebae Phthiotides.
Skiathos@Are there stories to tell of this island town?@Its history is bigger than its shoreline! At this place three ships of the Greeks - one from Troizen, one from Aegina, and one from Athens - waited and watched while the Persian fleet of Xerxes approached.%(Herodotus 7.179)
Skiathos@Are there stories to tell of this island town?@A temple of Artemis watches over the passage between Skiathos and the mainland: it commemorates the destruction of the Persian fleet off the Euboian coast. She is a goddess who can control the sea! You know the tale of how she demanded the blood of Iphigeneia before she let the Greeks sail to Troy: she locked up the winds and the favorable currents till they gave what she demanded.
Tisaia@The harbor is small and rugged, so I have heard@It is a long headland, good for steering, easy to see! 
Pieria@What are the stories of this land?@In this region lies the holiest of sites in all of Greece, Mount Olympus, home of the immortal gods. Upon the summit of Olympus sits the palace of Zeus and Hera, the king and queen on the gods. In this golden palace in the sky, the gods lounge in a dining hall on couches, sipping sweet ambrosia from their wine goblets, listening to Apollo strumming the lyre with the Muses singing in harmony, laughing amongst themselves as they contemplete the lives of us mere mortals dwelling on Earth below. (adapted from <i>Homer</i>, Iliad, 1.570-600)
Pieria@Tell me about this region.@Here in Pieria, the nine Muses were born. It is said that Zeus, the king of the gods, came to Mount Eleuther to lie with Mnemosyne, goddess of memory, for nine consecutive nights, conceiving their nine daughters. These daughters, the Muses, are goddesses presiding over the arts. They are as follows: Clio, Euterpe, Thaleia, Melpomene, Erato, Terpsichore, Polyhymnia, Urania, and Calliope. (adapted from <i>Hesiod</i>, Theogeny, 53,75)
Pieria@What are the tales of this land?@Pieria takes its name from Pierus, the father of nine daughters. Those nine daugters had such great arrogance, it ultimately led them to their doom. They believed that since they matched the Muses, the goddesses who inspire art and poetry, in number, they could surely prevail over them, and the nine daughters challenged the nine muses to competitions in the arts. What fools they were! It is well known that mortals cannot challenge divinities without punishment! As a penalty for their audacity, the nine daughters of Pierus were condemned to spend the rest of eternity as magpies. (adapted from <i>Ovid</i>, Metamorphoses 5.294ff)
Pieria@What can you tell me of this land?@In the distance lies Mount Pimpleia, a lofty mountain top that looms over this land. Its high summit is consecrated in honor of the nine Muses, goddesses presiding over the arts. (adapted from <i>Strabo</i>, Geography, 9.2.25)
Pieria@What are the tales of this land?@Pieria is the home of Orpheus, son of Calliope, the muse presiding over epic poetry, who bore him on the peaks of Pimpleia. Orpheus is well-known for the story in which he descended into the Underworld to retreive the soul of his wife, Eurydice, but looking back at her on the journey to Earth, and therefore disobeying the commands of the Gods, he lost her forever. Orpheus is also famed for his unmatched musical talents on the lyre, soothsaying, and his cult of mysteries. He gained followers, but many people suspected evil from him. Thus, a group plotted against Orpheus, killing him to stop potential evil in its tracks. (adapted from <i>Strabo</i>, Geography, 7.8.18)
Pieria@What can you tell me of Pieria's past?@It is said that the remains of Orpheus lie here. Orpheus disobeyed the orders of the Gods by turning back to glance at his wife, Eurydice, when retreiving her from the Underworld, resulting in her return to the kingdom of the dead. This miserable man's body was later torn to shreds by local women. His bones lie in an urn atop a pillar on the side of a road on the way from Dion to the mountain. (adapted from <i>Pausanias</i>, Description of Greece, 9.30.7)
Pieria@What are the tales of this land?@In this region lies a town by the name of Mothone. Here, King Phillip of Macedon, father of the infamous Alexander the Great, held a blockade against this city. Well, the people of Mothone are particularly skilled in archery. In one battle, Phillip was shot through his right eye with an arrow by an archer named Aster. King Phillip's eye was lost due to the wound. (adapted from <i>Solinus</i>, Polyhistor 8.7)
Torone@What can you tell me of this city?@Torone has long been hailed as the most important city in this region because of its harbor. During the Peloponnesian War, it was the last city on its penninsula to remain loyal to Athens and the Delian League until it was finally siezed by the victorious Spartans. (adapted from <i>Thucydides</i>, 4.110-116)
Torone@What are the myths of this city?@The waters around Torone are the dwellings of the sea-god and son of Posideon, Proteus, who rides the waves in a fish-drawn chariot and watches over seals. Proteus is a gifted seer who knows all things that have occured in the past and those which will transpire in the future. Take note of this old man's appearance, if chance allows it, for his form will change as quickly as he pleases. Proteus is a shape-shifter, and his divine powers allow him to transform into any beast he desires. (adapted from <i>Virgil</i>, Georgics 4.387-414).
Torone@What is this city famed for?@During his 9th labor, Heracles was tasked with bringing the belt of Hippolyta, queen of the Amazons, to Admete, daughter of Eurystheus. On his journey from Paros to deliver the belt, Heracles stopped in Torone, where he was challenged to a wrestling match by Polygonus and Telegonus, sons of Proteus, and grandsons of Poseidon. Heracles rose victorious, killing the two challengers and continuing safely on his voyage to Mycenae. (adapted from <i>Apollodorus</i>, Library 2.4.9)
Maroneia@What are the tales of this land?@On their journies home from the Trojan War, the Greek war heros Neoptolemus, son of Achilles, and Phoenix land in Maroneia and meet with Odysseus.

Zone@What can you tell me of this city?@In the city of Zone, there is a sanctuary to the goddess, Demeter, who presides over agriculture and harvesting. One day, Demeter's daughter by Lord Zeus, Persephone, was frolicking through fields, picking flowers, happy and carefree, when she caught the eye of Hades, god of the Underworld. Hades flew by in his golden chariot, siezing the young girl, and taking her to the Underworld with him to be his bride. Demeter heard her beloved daughter's screams and instantly set out on a search for Persephone. For nine days she searched the earth with torches in hand, neither bathing, nor resting, nor eating nectar nor drinking ambrosia. On the tenth day, it was revealed to her that Persephone had been taken to the Underworld by Hades with the permission of Zeus. Demeter's sorrow only grew, and she went into hiding on Earth amongst the mortals. Her greif was so great, that for an entire year, mortals were not able to reap a harvest. Zeus then struck a deal with Hades, so Demeter's wrath might be eased. Persephone was to spend two thirds of the year with her mother, and the final part of the year ruling the Underworld with her husband Hades. During the parts of the year Persephone and Demeter are united, fields and harvests flourish with Demeter's joy. When Persphone descends back to Hades, Demeter mourns and the fields are barren. This is why we have seasons. (adapted from <i>Homer</i>, Hymn to Demeter).

Hero would light the lamp in her tower, and Leander would swim across the strait to her, using it as his guide. One night, however, winter storms raged and blew out the lamp, and with it the life of Leander was extinguished. Seeing his body wash ashore the next morning, Hero threw herself from the tower, so they might be together once again in death.% (<i>Musaeus, Hero and Leander</i>)

Sestos@What is notable about this settlement, Sestos?@Here in Sestos, the eagle is an important bird to us. Once, a maiden brought up an eagle, and the bird was grateful to her, often bringing her birds and animals to eat. When the girl died, the bird threw itself upon the funeral pyre, burning with her. Seeing this, the inhabitants set up a heroon in that place, and named it the shrine of Jupiter and the Maiden, as the eagle is associated with Jupiter.% (<i>Pliny the Elder, Natural History 10.6.1</i>)
Sestos@What is notable about this settlement, Sestos?@This city was at one point captured by the Abydenes. Theodorus, a commander in the city, was having an affair with a woman in the suburbs. To meet secretly with her, Theodorus made a hole in the aqueduct, which he would replace after passing through the wall. One night, after his tongue was loosened with wine, Theodorus told this to his friend Cleon. Cleon immediately reported this to the Abydenes, who had several men enter the city at nightfall in this manner. After slaying the watch, they opened the gates for the rest of the troops, who were then easily able to capture Sestos.% (<i>Polyaenus, Strategems 1.37.1</i>)
