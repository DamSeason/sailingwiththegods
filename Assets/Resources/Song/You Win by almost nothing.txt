The laurel branch trembles, the Delian nods: your win is a wink in Apollo’s eye!
Hush the lyre, the swans sing more gently: you have won, in a trifling way!’
Envy remains locked in her lair: your win is real, but stirs up no strife.
Your triumph is fit for a mortal – not yet Apollo, not let like a muse! 
The golden belt, the golden bridles, the golden songs of Artemis’ attendants – will await a more glorious win; for now, the sound of a silver castanet.
Your speed is not that of a swift race horse – perhaps a cat who makes little vermin tremble. But the cat has its meal!
Not quite the warship, more like the nautilus, your victory glides over the waves
Yours is a branch of a local sapling, not yet palm of victory from Apollo’s isle!
Some victories merit a great hecatomb, 100 oxen slaughtered for the god; for yours, a chicken.
Compare your victory to the swirling Pleiades? Perhaps to a lamp, swung by a happy dancer.
