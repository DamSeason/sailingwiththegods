You have lost! You should rejoice that Hades is not watching: for such a performance he would make you the roll the Sisyphean rock!
You have lost! Ixion whirling on his fiery wheel has more joy in his deeds than you!   
You lose! You played like a player cursed by the Fates who bind sluggish tongues and tuneless mouths and lips and hearts and brains and souls and fingers which cannot snap in tune.
You lose! Ereshkigal rejoices, she rules you like she rules the dead: she has crumbled your thumbs like dried clay, clogged your eyes like a sluggish stream, bound your ears so you could not hear! 
You have lost! Your reputation is handed over to Hekate who devours, to the underworld which hides, to Hermes the thief who steals all that is precious.  
You have lost! Did some daimon bind your toes, your legs, your knees, your hips, your torso, your shoulders, your arms, your neck, every part of your body that should leap in the dance?
You have lost! Kore will hide your fame in a box, Hades will bind you to the lowest stone, Kerberos will gobble your reputation like a dog biscuit!
You have lost! Pull your oar, furl your sail: go see if the dolphins will dance with you, or the gulls who shriek all out of tune. 
You have lost! An untutored goatherd knows more music than you!
You have lost! A maenad out of her mind shows more grace than you! 
You have lost! Your performance makes the mad-dancing Korybantes seem like the march of stately maidens on Delos.
