You have lost! Your name will last no longer than the song of a sparrow.
You have lost! The sorriest man in Hades has more reputation than you!
You have lost! Thersites himself will be deemed better looking!
You have lost! Your ancestors hang their heads in shame…Apollo turns away his face….the Muses scatter, holding their tender hands over embarrassed ears.
You have lost! Go sing your song to the creatures of the sea, who hear nothing but the waves and the wind.
You have lost! The croaking toads and the chirping cicadas have more melodies than you!
