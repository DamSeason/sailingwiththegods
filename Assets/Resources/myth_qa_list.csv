Alope@what tales can you tell me of Alope’s past?@This town is named for a princess who loved the sea god! She was the daughter of the king of Eleusis: Poseidon the god of the waves fell in love with her, and she bore him a child Hippothoon, named for swift horses – appropriate for that horse-loving god! The horsey little lad was abandoned by his mother, but a mare nursed it until the shepherds found him. Eventually the royal little tyke was brought to the king: alas for his mother, the king – his own grandfather! - recognized who he was and locked up his mother as punishment, starving her to death.  As for the boy, Poseidon eventually turned him into a spring: a watery fate for a watery boy! (Pherekydes BNJ 3 F 147; Hyginus Fabulae 187, 238)@
Alope@what tales can you tell me of Alope’s past?@Alope lies in the territory of Achaea Phthiotis; behind the city looms Mount Othrys, where Kronos and the Titans had their base when the Titans warred against the Olympians. There too were born the great god Poseidon, Hades who rules the underworld, Hera wife if Zeus, Demeter and Hestia. You will sail into legendary territory!@
Anthedon@what are the tales of Anthedon?@Anthedonians are famous for covetousness – keep a sharp eye on your wallet there! The Boiotians say that greed lives in Oropos, envy in Tanagra, stupidity in Haliartus and covetousness in Anthedon (Herakleides Criticus, Bios Ellados 25)@
Anthedon@what are the tales of Anthedon?@This town has its poets! Anthes of Anthedon was the first author of hymns (Ps-Plutarch, On Music 2.3)@
Anthedon@what are the tales of Anthedon?@Be sure to order carefully at your restaurants there! The hake fish grows to great size around Anthedon, but its meat is rather spongy, not very pleasant, at least to me, though some like it (Athenaeus Deipnosophistae 7.316)@
Anthedon@what are the tales of Anthedon?@Old tombs and old tales await  you! Mycenaean remains are to be seen, and the place flourished from a fine fishing and seafaring industry. And the tales of Glaukos have their start here – he was a fisherman, and an excellent diver, but more than mortal: he has become a god of the sea and a powerful prophet.  Some say that he visits, every year,  every island and every beach, accompanied by seamonsters and making prophecies (Pausanias 9.22.6)  @
Anthedon@what are the tales of Anthedon?@Anthedon is the home of Glaukos, the prophesying demon of the sea – and I saw it myself, his transformation into a God! I was not bleary-eyed or peering vainly to no purpose when I saw this fearful thing, this awful happening. You know, I am a countryman and of these parts; and I am always about the land here opposite Chalcis, and am used to accompany the grazing cattle from the byre to Messapion's leafless lofty crag. And it was from here that my eye lit upon it. I saw it when I had come to the bend of Euboia, about the headland of Zeus Crenaeus, right by unhappy Lichas' tomb. (adapted from Aeschylus Fr. 273) @
Anthedon@what are the tales of Anthedon?@The town is the home of the sea-god Glaukos! You may have heard of him: Plato tells us “The nature of the sea-god Glaukos can hardly be made out by those who catch glimpses of him, because the original members of his body are broken off and mutilated and crushed and in every way marred by the waves, and other parts have attached themselves to him, accretions of shells and sea-weed and rocks, so that he is more like any wild creature than what he was by nature.” (Plato Republic 611d)@
Anthedon@what are the tales of Anthedon?@By the sea at Anthedon in Boiotia is what is called the Leap of Glaukos.  That Glaukos was a fisherman, who, on eating of the grass, turned into a deity of the sea and ever since has foretold to men the future, is a belief generally accepted; in particular, sea-faring men tell every year many a tale about the soothsaying of Glaukos.  (Pausanias Description of Greece 9.22.7)@
Anthedon@what are the tales of Anthedon?@You would sail into the home of the sea-god Glaukos! “So Glaucus of Anthedon, the fisher of the Boeotian sea, having tasted Circe's deadly herbs, when he had plucked those plants cropped by his dying fish, plunged into the Carpathian sea, there to find a new home: that fisherman, so skilful with his hooks and nets, who ransacked Nereus' hidden depths and swept the surface which is Tethys' realm that spoiler tossed on the waves amid the shoals he once took captive” (Ausonius Mosella 240)@
Doris@tell me of this place, Doris? @This city bears the name of a sea nymph! Doris was the wife of Nereus, god of the sea, and the mother of fifty beautiful Nereids; she is the right goddess for this city, as she rules over the fishing grounds that flourish where fresh rivers meet the salt sea: her name means ‘pure gift’, an apt title for a goddess with access to sweet river water! Hesiod sings her tale:  ‘Doris of the lovely hair, daughter of Okeanos the river that encircles us all; to nereus she bore, even in the barren sea, daughters whose beauty is outstanding even among the gods’. (Theogony 240-244)@
Doris@tell me of this place, Doris? @In the name of this city lies the Dorian race – those who think ‘Doris’ means ‘woodland’ or ‘upland’, appropriate for its mountain slopes! Dorians are the children of Herakles, who drove away the Dryopes from this site to claim it as their own: you may call them ‘hunger Dorians’, since they took such rich farmland! The soil is deep, the water abundant, springing from the Kephissos river; three mountain ranges protect her round about (Skylax 62). Those Dryopes were brigands, pirates of the dry land: from there they ranged far and wide.@
Euboia@What can you tell me of the island?@This island has had many names! Some used to call it ‘big’ (Makris), others ‘Long’ (Doliche), - others Abantis, for the warrior tribes who lived here (Iliad 2.540-541, ‘ the raging Abantes who held Euboia and Chalcis and Eretria and Histiaia with its fine vineyards, and Kerinthos on the sea ….) Now we call it ‘The land of the well-fed oxen’, Euboia.@
Euboia@What can you tell me of the island?@After rounding Sounion from Attike the island Euboia lies ahead, previously called, they say, Makris (“long”) from its nature, next from the so-called Asopis, taking with time again the name Euboia. The first to inhabit it, they say, were mixed Lelegian settlers; Pandoros the son of Erechtheos crossed over from Attike to found Chalkis, the largest city on it, and Aiklos, an Athenian by race, founded Eretria, and likewise Kothos founded Kerinthos on the shore; Dryopes founded the city named Karystos, while Hestiaia was a foundation of the Perrhaibians. Islands lie near it, Skyros, Peparethos, Skiathos; the Cretans who crossed over from Knossos with Staphylos once settled Peparethos and Ikos, the island lying near it, while legend says Pelasgians crossed over from Thrace to settle Skyros and Skiathos. The Chalcidians resettled all of them after they became deserted. (Geographi Graeci Minores 566)@
Euboia@What can you tell me of the island?@This place may only be an island because of the hand of Poseidon: earthquakes shook it, long ago, and it may have been these that separated it from the mainland Greeks (Thucydides, Strabo)@
Euboia@What can you tell me of the island?@It is the first place the Greeks, sailing to Troy, found themselves stalled ! At Euboia, near Chalcis, Agamemnon and his men were held in place when the winds were denied them, due to the king’s arrogance and his offence to Artemis.@

Euboia@What can you tell me of the island?@The nymph of the island is as famous as the island is grand in size and reputation. Euboea was the nymph of the fountain, daughter of the river god Asopos. She stole the heart of the sea-god Poseidon; he stole her from her father, brought her to the island, and made it her home forever (Diodorus Siculus 4.72.1; Corinna Fr. 654)  @
Euboia@What can you tell me of the island?@Poseidon is worshipped here – and in the cities the Euboians founded!  He is honored at Mende,  as shaker of the earth and god of the sea; in Zankle in the far west, the god’s own son Orion set up his father’s sanctuary; on Euboea itself Orion has a cult. And in Aigai on Euboia, Poseidon has a shrine (Hesiod Fr. 149 MW; Diodorus Siculus 4.85; Strabo 9; Pausanias 9.20.3).@
Euboia@What can you tell me of the island?@"Euboea worship mighty Briareos: Of him Hesiod wrote: ""Three other sons, Hekatoncheires were born of Gaia and Ouranos, great and doughty beyond telling, Kottos and Briareos and Gyes, presumptuous children. From their shoulders sprang a hundred arms, not to be approached, and each had fifty heads upon his shoulders on their strong limbs, and irresistible was the stubborn strength that was in their great forms."""@
Euboia@What can you tell me of the island?@"Euboea worship mighty Briareos: Hesiod tells his story: ""But the glorious allies of loud-crashing Zeus, the Hekatonkheires, have their dwelling upon Okeanos' foundations, namely Kottos and Gyes; but Briareos, being goodly, the deep-roaring Earth-Shaker Poseidon made his son-in-law, giving him Kymopoliea (“Wave-Roaming”) his daughter to wed."""@

(Aeneid 6.287-90)"@
Euboia@What can you tell me of the island?@"Euboea worship mighty Briareos: Aelian cites Aristotle, saying that before the pillars of Herakles were so called they were known as the pillars of Briareos. But when Herakles purified both land and sea and became indisputably the benefactor of mankind, men honored him, named the pillars after Herakles and ceased to honor the memory of Briareos."" Historical Miscellany 5.3"@
Histiaia/Oreos@If I hire a guide, will he have tales to tell me?@Some think it has its name because Orion was raised here, that handsome giant and hunter! He followed in the company of Artemis on Crete (Apollodoros Bibliotheca 1.4.3; Hyginus Poeticon Astronomicon 2.34);  some say she loved him, and Apollo tricked her into shooting him as he swam in the sea. Or it may be that he loved her against her will, so she sent him a monster of a scorpion to kill him (Horace Carmina 2.4.72; Apollodoros Bibliotheca 1.4.5).  It lies at the foot of the mountain Telethrius, on the river Callas, on a high rock (Strabo 10.1.4)@
Histiaia/Oreos@If I hire a guide, will he have tales to tell me?@Artemis Proseoa is celebrated here – ‘Artemis who faces the East’ – this is where the navy of the Greeks anchored in 480 for three days, as they fought off the fleet of Persian Xerxes, who here sought critical access to the gulf.

Those Abantes descended from Ares, and were generous of spirit; they wore their hair long in battle, tying it at their backs and shearing it at the front, a haircut called the ‘Theseis’ for the great Theseus (Plutarch Theseus. 5.1; Homer Iliad 2.540-550)@

Histiaia/Oreos@If I hire a guide, will he have tales to tell me?@Former enemies, settlers and rulers are now among its network of friends! They are now aligned with Athens, but long ago they were part of an uprising against that city, and even murdered the crew of one of her ships. Because of this the Athenians sent 2000 settlers to Histiaia’s shores (Livy 28.6.2; 31.46.9). Later it was  part of the Athenian league (Livy 28.5.18), then ruled by Macedon. @

Kerinthos@What tales can you tell me of this place?@There are minerals here famous for their properties. Theophrasuts wrote, “There appears to be a kind of earth in some places, which when sprinkled over the seed helps to make wheat keep, for instance, the earth found at Olynthos and at Kerinthos in Euboea; this makes the grain inferior for food, but fuller in appearance; the earth is sprinkled in the proportion of one pint to twenty-four of grain (Enquiry into Plants, 8.11.6)@
Kerinthos@What tales can you tell me of this place?@This is a small town (Strabo 10.446), near the banks of the river Budorus: Kothos of Athens was her founder, and she was sufficiently tied into the world of Greek cities to send ship to Ilium to fight against the Trojans!

Pelion@The mountain is the source for the wood of my ship! Poets to come will sing of that fact: “Once they say pine-trees born on the heights of Pelion floated through Neptune’s clear waves, to the River Phasis and Aeetes (Catullus 64.1) And it is great in size: Dicaearchus, a savant of the first rank, with the support of royal patrons took the measurement of mountains, and published that the highest of them was Pelion, with an altitude of 1250 paces (Pliny the Elder, Natural History 1-11, 2.65.1) I know some stories of this place – can you tell me more?@Wise old Herodotus tells us the tale of the shipwreck of the Persian fleet – and the mountain’s role in it!! “When the darkness had come on, although the season was the middle of summer, yet there came on very abundant rain, which lasted through the whole of the night, with crashing thunder from Mount Pelion; and the dead bodies and pieces of wreck were cast up at Aphetai and became entangled round the prows of the ships and struck against the blades of the oars: and the men of the army who were there, hearing these things became afraid, expecting that they would certainly perish, to such troubles had they come; for before they had had even breathing space after the shipwreck and the storm which had arisen off Mount Pelion, there had come upon them a hard sea-fight, and after the sea-fight a violent storm of rain and strong streams rushing to the sea and crashing thunder (Histories 8.12)@

Some which grow on Pelion are found as well in Pontus and Thrace, some about Oeta, Parnassus, Ossa and Telethrion, and in these parts some say that there is great abundance (Theophrastus Enquiry into Plants 4.5.1-2) @
Pelion@Worthy details, but are there not myths to share?@It is an infamous place, for infamous deeds of the immortals themselves! Otos and Ephialtes, whose names mean ‘insatiate’ and ‘nightmare’, were the sons of Iphimede, wife of Aloeos, whom she bore to Poseidon. They were  of extraordinary size - they each grew nine inches every month, and so when they were nine years old, they tried to climb into heaven. They began this way: they placed Mount Ossa on Pelion (from this Mount Ossa is also called Pelion), and were piling up other mountains. But they were discovered by Apollo and killed. …When they wished to assault Diana, she could not resist their strength, and Apollo sent a deer between them. Driven mad by anger in trying to kill it with javelins, they killed each other. In the Land of the Dead they are said to suffer this punishment: they are bound by serpents to a column, back to back. Between them is a screech-owl, sitting on the column to which they are bound. (Hyginus, Fabulae 28)@

Pelion@but you must know that it is the land of centaurs – the race descended from Ixion, who assaulted Hera – or thought he did! It was a cloud he attacked, not the goddess herself, but the cloud bore him a child – “a monstrous offspring-there was never a mother or a son like this-honored neither by men nor by the laws of the gods. She raised him and named him Centaurus, and he mated with the Magnesian mares in the foothills of Pelion, and from them was born a marvelous horde, which resembled both its parents: like the mother below, the father above. The gods accomplish everything according to their wishes” (Pindar Pythian 2.25)@A dreadful tale! And Chiron himself lives there!@
