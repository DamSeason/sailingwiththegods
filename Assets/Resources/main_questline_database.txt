If you’re going to act like an Argonaut, you need to begin your quest at Pagasae. Evil King Pelias will send you on a crazy impossible (?) quest to retrieve the golden fleece, taking you through a specific series of stops. You can follow this quest to win the game. Or you can win by getting rich, beating pirates, and making monuments to yourself. Your progress in either case is traced through your clout – see the cloutometer beneath your icon. If you want to follow the quest, head to Pagasae! Go to the tavern if you want to hire a navigator.@Message@You are at Pagasae: you make a big impression! You’re good looking and your ship is (literally) divine: Athena made it, and put in an oracular piece of timber from Dodona, where the gods spoke through the winds in the leaves. Better make the gods happy: you make a sacrifice, have a feast, and sing as song as you set off, led by Orpheus who could sing magical tunes.

If you get lost, better ask directions, either in a tavern or from your crew, whom you have not yet dehydrated, right?@Message@Here lies Dolops! He was a son of Hermes, as tricky as his father but much less immortal. That trickiness, for you, means he stirred up nasty storms until you entertained him with two days of barbecue and athletic competition (Superbowl for Dolops?)

But the gods have other plans: a storm drives you back to port, and in the darkness the Cyzicenes attack you; you yourself accidentally kill the king! The result is great mourning, and another horrible storm. The gods finally intervene, and send a bird of the sea to your seer Mopsos; the bird tweets instructions for a powerful ritual that will appease the wrath of nature.

The ship sets sail without them. Once you realize this, you are about to turn back.

The entrance lies between Byzantion and Chalcedon. Both cities were settled by the Greeks of Megara; they chose Chalcedon first, which was so much less promising a site that the Persian Megabazos called Chalcedon ‘the city of the blind.’@Message@You have arrived at Hieron, a vital site in Thynia. In historical times, this was the place to celebrate Zeus of the Winds; for the Argonauts, you need to beware the Harpies, the hounds of Zeus! They are women, they are wind, they are violent and they are half-birds. And, they are hungry. And, they smell awful. They punish Phineus, a seer who angered Zeus by giving prophecies that were too accurate; the Harpies snatch his food from his table and befoul what they cannot take. You free the sad old man with the help of Zetes and Calais, two sons of the North Wind who are among your crew: they engage in the first airborne battle in history, driving the Harpies far, far away to the Floating Islands, which were imagined to be in Crete, Sicily or beyond. Here they lock the windy birdwomen underground, and return to their rejoicing buddies. Phineus tells everyone how to get to the Black Sea: you must pass through the clashing rocks.

Here the Acheron river tumbles into daylight, rising from the underworld. Smooth rocks and pounding sea lie below; a wide-spreading plane tree grows on the highest point of the promontory, an easy point for sailors to steer by. Also a pretty scary point for sailors to steer by.@Message@You arrive at Acherusia, the land of Mariandyni, ruled by good king Lycus. Herakles helped his family long ago, and he welcomes you as his friends. He is most impressed that you beat Amycus to death, which seems to him a fine recommendation for sending his own son, Dasyclus, with you on your journey. But enough good news: Idmon the seer meets his end here, gored by a white tusked boar: he had foreseen his death, one of the benefits of being a seer after all. You bury him in a great tomb just beneath the headland: his tomb will guide ships on their way just as he guided you. You then lose Tiphys your helmsman, who would read the stars and guide your way: a swift sickness took him to Hades. You bury him alongside Idmon and appoint Ancaeus to take his place.

And once again an ancient hero rises from the tomb to demand attention from you: he cannot stay underground, given the chance to gaze on you (you remind him so much of, well, himself…..). This is Sthenelaos, who was killed while accompanying Herakles on his quest to steal the belt of the Amazon queen. That belt is a metaphor for all her power – and Sthenelaos lost all of his, meeting his doom in the quest. Herakles himself built the tomb for his friend; Mopsos the seer tells you to approach the tomb, offer Sthenelaos some libations, and build an altar to Apollo who Saves our Ships. Orpheus offered his lyre as a gift to the god, and the name ‘Lyre’ to the place he left it.

The place is named for Sinope, a lovely Naiad of the Pontus, who caught Zeus’s eye (admit it, pretty much everyone did). The city was famous historically as the home of Diogenes, the great Cynic philosopher. That cynicism could have started with Zeus. He was desperate to sleep with Sinope, and promised her anything she wanted in return: she responded that she wanted her virginity.

Their mother Nephele, a cloud nymph, wouldn’t let this happen, and sent a flying golden ram to save them.

But though your crew looks for him everywhere, you cannot find him. More sad events happen here: Canthus dies, as was foretold for him, as well as Mopsus the seer. You mourn and bury your friends: how will you find your route, with Mopsus gone? Orpheus provides the answer: you should offer to the god of the lake the second tripod Apollo gave you. This works! Triton appears, happy with the gift, and tells you how to leave the lake. You and your men sacrifice a sheep to him, and the god himself carries your boat to the open sea.

27@City@190@TRUE@Sail to Crete@Sail to Crete! Head east to Crete. If you see Carpathus, you must follow the islands back to the west. If you see the Peloponnesus, you have not gone far enough to the east.@Message@Once you reach Crete, you meet a new challenge: the island is guarded by Talos, a giant man of bronze who walks around the circumference of the island three times a day. Medea conquers him for you, casting a spell that makes him graze his ankle on a rock and spill out his ichor, the fluid that animates him. You and the Argonauts then spend the night here and create an altar to Athena in the morning. You then set sail for Anaphe.@172_321@-1@8_21@stop_default@“The Argonauts landing at the Tomb of Dolops” / Source Ye gods and little fishes, 1900.

28@City@136@TRUE@Head to Anaphe@Look for a way to Anaphe! Head north to that bare island they call Anaphe, watching for the nearby tiny isle of Hippouris.@Message@You were lost in the dark at sea until Apollo leaped down from heaven onto the island’s rocks, and held up his gleaming golden bow. That flashing light led you here, so you name the place ‘Anaphe’, ‘The Island of Revealing’. You want to make a thank offering to Apollo but have nothing but at this point have little more than water to pour as libations. Medea’s maidens, accustomed to the finery of the palace in Colchis, find this enormously amusing. They mock you, you and the men mock them back: comic relief! After some rest, you and your crew set sail for Aegina.@237@-1@-1@stop_default@“The Argonauts landing at the Tomb of Dolops” / Source Ye gods and little fishes, 1900.

Navagate northwest through a series of small islands to Aegina.@Message@While at sea, Euphemus dreams that the clod of dirt that had been given to him by Triton turned into a lovely maiden. You, Jason, recognize what this means, and convince him to throw the clod into the sea. Up rises the island of Calliste rises up from the very place the dirt entered the water. You then dock on the shores of Aegina and rest in order that you arrive at Pagasae on the next day!@-1@-1@-1@stop_default@“The Argonauts landing at the Tomb of Dolops” / Source Ye gods and little fishes, 1900.
