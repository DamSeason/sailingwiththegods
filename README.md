This game is designed to:

* maximize immersion in the realities of sailing the ancient sea, closing the gap between our modern perspectives of sea travel and ancient realities
* generate data recorded from playersâ€™ behavioral patterns when making choices about how to move about the maritime networks
* integrate ancient voices from history and mythology with geospatial realities of economic resources, political trends and potential for gathering up to date knowledge

# Setup

This Build uses Unity 2019.4.9f1

While the main game code is open source, the game depends on a private repo for assets purchased from the Unity Asset Store. This should go in the ```Assets/_Proprietary``` folder. Access to the proprietary repo is limited, but if it is missing the project will populate with open source fallback assets upon loading for the first time in Unity.

## Git Setup for Windows

* Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) using **default settings**
  * Make sure you pick **"Git Credential Manager Core"**
* Check if you have / need access to the proprietary repo
* Use https athentication steps below to clone your fork

## Using https authentication

```
git clone yourforkurl --branch develop
git remote add upstream https://github.com/kddressel/sailingwiththegods.git

# and if you have access to the proprietary repo...
git submodule update --init
```

* After running git submodule update --init, you should get a github login popup
* Choose "Sign in with your browser"
* Authorize GitCredentialManager to your github account
* Wait for a while. The submodule is large and may not appear to be downloading immediately

## Using ssh authentication

```
git clone yourforkurl --branch develop
git remote add upstream git@github.com:kddressel/sailingwiththegods.git

# and if you have access to the proprietary repo...
git submodule update --init
```

Most of the team is using https, so the submodule is stored as https in the .gitmodules to ease that workflow. It's recommended to use https for the submodule and ssh for the main repo if you are using ssh, but if you want to use ssh for the submodule you can do this:

* Edit .git/config
* Point the Assets/_Proprietary submodule url at ```git@github.com:kddressel/sailingwiththegods-proprietary.git```
* cd into Assets/Proprietary
* rm -rf .git
* git init
* git remote add origin ```git@github.com:kddressel/sailingwiththegods-proprietary.git```
