# Editor Settings (see .editorconfig)

## Indentation:
  * Real Tabs, not spaces
  * Tab width: 4
  * unix line endings
  * UTF-8, no BOM

## Blocks:
  * Braces on same line for methods, control blocks
  * Braces on a new line for classes, structs, enums, and everything else

# Style Conventions

## Class Names
  * Begin with Capital letter. Use PascalCase.
  * For MonoBehaviours, must match the filename
  * Exception for legacy classes. Should aim to clean these up later

## Variable and Function Names
  
  * There's a lot of legacy code that does not follow this convention. Unless doing a refactor pass, we've been matching the surrounding code for the most part
  * Follow the Microsoft guidelines: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/names-of-type-members
    * All static and member functions should be PascalCase
    * Local variables should be camelCase, including local functions
    * Local variables should use var when the type is apparent from context
      * var makes it easier to read the structure and intent of the code at a glance
      * This includes in Linq queries. The return type of Linq queries is always IEnumerable
    * All public and protected fields and properties should be PascalCase
      * This includes constants
    * Generally, don't make public and protected fields. Use properties instead for publicly visible API.
      * Exception for plain old data objects (this deviates from the Microsoft guidelines, but Unity's serialization system doesn't work with properties so public fields are more practical here)
  * Use  \_camelCase for private fields

## Readability/Maintainability

  * Delete unused code. It obscures the functionality
  * Always have no warnings in Unity, so that when new warnings pop up, we'll notice.
  * Scoping, encapsulation, separation of concerns
    * Hide as much as possible from other systems within a system, to   prevent bugs related to modifying data you're not supposed to.
    * Code with minimal dependencies on other code should be separated into separate files and separate systems.
  * Cyclomatic complexity
    * Avoid excessive nesting of if blocks

## Inspector Guidelines

Only show things in the inspector that should actually be set in the inspector. Otherwise it's unclear how things are expected to be hooked up.

* Use `private` (default for no qualifier) for things not referenced in any other scripts
* Use properties or `[HideInInspector]` for things that are accessed in other scripts but aren't meant to be set in the inspector. Prefer properties when possible.
* Use `[ReadOnly]` for things that are shown in the inspector but are just there for debug and aren't accessed in other scripts
* Use `[SerializeField]` if not accessed publicly, exception for legacy code already using public. Convert when convenient.
  * Use `[SerializeField] GameObject _myReferenceObject = null;` to avoid warning 0649 "Field is never assigned to". Leaving off the = null on private fields gives this warning.
